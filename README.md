# Backproagation Introduction

**This is the documentation of Intro to neural networks & backpropagation lecture i had gone through by *Anjrej Karpathy***

Develop basic intuition behind the backpropagation, while learning you will be implementing the _MICROGRAD_ framework developed by anjrej.

Things covered in the whole lecture :

1) what is Forward pass ?
2) what is backward pass ?
3) what are gradients ?
4) Implementing tanh non-linearity ( Activation Function )
5) what is Backpropagation ?
6) what is loss function ?
